# Supervised Machine Learning in R

## Overview 
R is a powerful language for statistical computing. A prolific user community backs R with with an extensive library of packages. If you can think of it, somebody has already written a library for it. R also has a superb IDE, R Studio, facilitating reproducible research. 

This course is for people with some R programming experience. It gives an overview of supervised statistical modeling and machine learning in R. We will focus on a small subset of algorithms and emphasize out-of-sample evaluation.

## What You Will Learn 
This course introduces R capabilities for regression and classification. Many machine learning algorithms exist and it is only possible to cover a small subset in a single class. We will focus on:
* Linear and logistic regression
* Decision tree and SVM classifiers
* Training sets and test sets
* K-fold cross-validation
* Prediction vs. inference


## Course Outline 
* Workflow: Setting up an R Studio Project and file structure.
* Review of R, R Studio
* CRAN task view: machine learning
* Training, testing, and k-fold cross validation
* Decision trees and random forests
* Support vector machines
* General linear models, focusing on logistic regression
* Linear regression models


## Promise Statement 
After this course you will have used several supervised machine learning methods. You will understand how to use out-of-sample evaluation methods for your models. Where possible, you will learn to perform inference with these models.

## Prerequisites 
* Bring a computer with wifi connection capability and a power cord
* Install the latest versions of GNU-R (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) and R Studio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
